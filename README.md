# Image-search-App
This app was design to generate random image through a third party site unplash!!

it was made via three stack languages: 
1:HTML
2:CSS
4:JS

1: The HTML file contains the structure of the design, containing different HTML element and tags.

2: The CSS file contains the decoration design, using the element, tags, class and id of the HTML to decorate it.

3: The JS code which contains the fetch API from unplash and uses a function to access the API and fetch the result from unplash and move the fetch data into a template created in the JS function and display them.

Please review and comment for improvement. Thanks
